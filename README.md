I created my repo week12-SQL
I added this Readme
I then added the following porgrams
npm install --save mysql2
npm install inquirer
npm install console.table --save
I tried to run the next one but turminal said that there was not a path
bower install console.table --save
I then added gitignore and put node_modules inside before I did a git push
I then did a git push so now I think I have things ready to go
