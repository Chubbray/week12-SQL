I created my repo week12-SQL.
I added this Readme.
I then added the following porgrams -
npm install --save mysql2,
npm install inquirer,
npm install console.table --save.
I tried to run the next one but turminal said that there was not a path -
bower install console.table --save.
I then added gitignore and put node_modules inside before I did a git push.
I then did a git push so now I think I have things ready to go.
Worked with my tutor to creat schema.sql and the got started on seeds.sql.
Finished creating seeds.sql.
Created index.js and started to creat the code, I need to go through the lesson again to make suer I am doing things right.
I created server.js and started the code but it still needs a lot of work.

I will come back to this later on to finish. It is late due to me getting activated with the guard for the state.
